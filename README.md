Got it — you have a set of Jupyter notebooks for different machine learning algorithms.
Here’s a **README.md** draft you can use for documentation:

# Machine Learning Algorithms Collection

This repository contains implementations of various **machine learning algorithms** using Python and popular libraries like **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, and **matplotlib**. Each algorithm is implemented in its own Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) for easy understanding and experimentation.

## 📂 Repository Structure

* **DecisionTree.ipynb** – Implementation of Decision Tree Classifier/Regressor with visualization of decision boundaries and tree structure.
* **KNN.ipynb** – K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classification and regression problems.
* **Kmeans.ipynb** – Unsupervised learning using K-Means clustering with visualization of clusters.
* **Linear\_Regression.ipynb** – Simple and multiple linear regression for predicting continuous values.
* **Logistic\_Regression.ipynb** – Logistic regression for binary and multi-class classification tasks.
* **RandomForest.ipynb** – Random Forest classifier/regressor using an ensemble of decision trees.
* **SVM.ipynb** – Support Vector Machine classifier with kernel methods for complex decision boundaries.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook

If you want, I can also **add a “theory + implementation” section** in the README so it briefly explains each algorithm’s concept before linking to the notebook. That would make it more beginner-friendly.
